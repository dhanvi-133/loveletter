Blue Love Letter

A simple static page that shows a blue-themed love letter with hearts and flowers. It includes two buttons: "Yes" and "No". Each time the "No" button is clicked it shows a different gentle reply (3 variants). Clicking "Yes" shows an acceptance message and a small animation.

Files created:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — blue theme and decorations
- `script.js` — button behavior and messages
- `README.md` — this file

How to open
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with).

Optional (PowerShell) to open in default browser from the folder:

```powershell
Start-Process "index.html"
```

Behavior notes
- No button: cycles through 3 different friendly messages; a 4th and later clicks show a final gentle message.
- Yes button: shows acceptance, disables both buttons and plays a brief heart animation.

If you want changes (different messages, colors, more animations), tell me what to adjust.
